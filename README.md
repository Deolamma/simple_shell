# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
##### In this project we attempt to create a shell but a simpler version of the shell, In this shell version we will:
- Create processes
- Manipulate the environment of currently running processes
- Suspend the execution of processes while waiting for child processes to terminate
- Ensure that our error messages mimicks the error message displayed by the shell
- Implement built-ins such as (Exit, env, cd)
- Test our knowledge of the C programming language by exploring both basic and complex concepts in the language from pointers to structures to functions to sytem calls, even building our own custom library fxns

#### Wish us luck
